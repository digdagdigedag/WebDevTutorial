  <p>The first edition of this work was published in 1854, and, although
    a large one, has been long out of print. Many inquiries having been
    made for it since the recent lamented death of the translator, the
    publishers have determined to offer a second edition to the public,
    and have been advised to give it a place in their "English and Foreign
    Philosophical Library." It is an exact reprint of the first edition,
    and they trust it will be received with equal favour.</p>
